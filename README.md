# Algo-V (V for Visualization)
Algo-V is my way to learn algorithm. Algo is hard without any visual approach, so here it is. The process is highly inspired by one amazing Algorithm course in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/).

**The Project is WIP (Work in Progress)**

What I learn from building this:
1. Neovim 
2. SvelteKit
3. DaisyUI
4. Data Driven Documents (D3.js)
5. Algorithms
